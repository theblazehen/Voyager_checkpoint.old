async function craftIronSword(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting an iron sword. First, it checks if there are enough iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, mines and smelts iron ore to obtain them. Next, it ensures there is a stick in the inventory, crafting one if necessary. Then, it searches for a nearby crafting table, placing one if none is found. Finally, it crafts the iron sword using 2 iron ingots and 1 stick, and reports the completion of the task.
