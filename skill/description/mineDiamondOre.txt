async function mineDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining 1 diamond ore using a suitable pickaxe. First, it checks if the bot has an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe in the inventory. If not, it crafts an iron pickaxe. Then, the bot moves to level 11 (Y-coordinate) to start mining for diamonds. It uses the exploreUntil function to find a diamond_ore block. Once found, the bot equips the suitable pickaxe and mines the diamond_ore block. Finally, it reports the completion of the task.
