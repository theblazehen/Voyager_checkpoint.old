async function craftCopperBlocks(bot) {
    // The function aims to craft 9 copper blocks. First, it checks if there are enough copper ingots in the inventory, and if not, mines the required amount of copper and coal ores. Then, it places a furnace and smelts the copper ores into ingots using coal as fuel. Next, it places a crafting table if not present and crafts 9 copper blocks using the copper ingots. Finally, it reports the completion of the task.
