async function mineLapisLazuliOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a Lapis Lazuli ore using an appropriate pickaxe. First, it checks if the bot has a stone, iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe in its inventory. If a suitable pickaxe is found, the bot equips it. If not, the bot informs the user and exits. The bot then searches for a Lapis Lazuli ore block nearby or explores the area to find one. Once the ore block is found, the bot mines it using the equipped pickaxe and reports the task completion.
