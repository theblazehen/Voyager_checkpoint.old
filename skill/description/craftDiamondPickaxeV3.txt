    // The function crafts a diamond pickaxe by first checking if there are enough diamonds and sticks in the inventory. If not, it explores the surroundings to find and mine diamond ores, and crafts sticks as needed. Then, it checks for a nearby crafting table, placing one if necessary. Finally, it crafts the diamond pickaxe using 3 diamonds and 2 sticks, and reports the completion of the task.
