async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 1 coal ore using a wooden pickaxe. First, it checks if a wooden pickaxe is in the inventory, and if not, it crafts one using a crafting table. It then searches for a nearby coal ore block and, if not found, explores the surroundings until one is located. Once a coal ore block is discovered, the wooden pickaxe is equipped in hand and the coal ore block is mined. Finally, the task completion is reported.
