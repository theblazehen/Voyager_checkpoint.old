async function craftStonePickaxe(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a stone pickaxe. First, it checks if there is a stone pickaxe in the inventory. If not, it ensures there are enough cobblestone and sticks by mining cobblestone and crafting sticks if needed. Then, it places a crafting table if one is not already placed. Finally, it crafts the stone pickaxe using 3 cobblestone and 2 sticks, and reports the completion of the task.
